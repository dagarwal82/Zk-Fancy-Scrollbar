Special thanks author Ryan Johnson <http://syntacticx.com/> for scroll.js which does the main job.

1) css/fancy.css (css of fancy scroll)
2) js/scroll.js ( I am using document.write in scroll.js , you might need to link all the js in your zul if ur zul is in different folder
3) images/nodata (shows empty images while there is no data in listbox/grid)
